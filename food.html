			<a id="interval"><h1>Interval Cafe Bar</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				One of the main attractions of the SU's level 2 is the 'Interval' cafe and bar which describes itself as a "laid back and
				sophisticated cafe bar serving a selection of fine wine, continental beers, Fairtrade hot drinks, and tasty cuisine".
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/interval4.jpg" alt="Picture of the interval" title="The Interval" width=100%> <!-- Picture of the Interval -->
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Interval Bar and Cafe is a perfect location to go for a nice lunch or dinner. Their extensive lunch and dinner menus leave
				you with lots of choice of different foods, all of which are sure not to disappoint.
			</p>
			<p>
				The slightly higher prices means that it might not be the best place to go every week, but could be a nice treat to have lunch there
				with a friend every so often.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pleasant atmosphere and comfy decore all add to the experience making your time there all the more memorable.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/interval6.jpg" alt="Picture of the interval" title="The Interval" width=100%> <!-- Picture of the Interval -->
			</figure>
			<p>
				I would recommend the arancini for a starter, the linguini meatball marinara for main, and chocolate brownie stack for
				dessert if you can fit it all in. Other options are their artisan pizzas or their tasty sandwich meal deals,
				which cut the cost down significantly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Their full menus and more can be found at the <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/interval" target="blank">SU's page</a>
				for the Interval.
			</p>

			<a id="barOne"><h1>Bar One</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				Inside level one of the SU we have 'Bar One', a Students' Union bar which prides itself on its
				"burgers, quizzes, sport and friendly staff!".
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/barOne4.jpg" alt="Picture of bar one" title="Bar One" width=100%> <!-- Picture of Bar One -->
			</figure>
			<p>
				As a more lively venue, Bar One is the go-to venue for students wanting a cheap night out or a place to hang out and have a
				drink before going into town.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bar One's tasty burgers and pool tables make this the perfect stopping point for an evening out with friends, or could
				even serve as a great place to grab a pub lunch and watch the football on the big screens.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information on Bar One's and its menus visit the <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/bar-one" target="blank">SU's page</a>

			<a id="grillAndGo"><h1>Grill & Go</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				On the third floor of the SU, we have 'Grill & Go', a "campus favourite...perfect for those on the go". They offer
				a variety of different fast foods including  "burritos, hot wraps and salad boxes", all of which are "cooked fresh
				and made to order".
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/grillAndGo1.jpg" alt="Picture of grill and go" title="Grill and Go" width=100%> <!-- Picture of Grill and Go -->
			</figure>
			<p>
				Grill & Go's quick, cheap and easy food is a must try at some point during your time here in Sheffield. They offer a wide range
				of interesting and unique combos of burritos and wraps, all made to your order in front of you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're in the need of a quick meal you and are in the mood for a wrap or burrito don't think twice, go to Grill & Go.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would recommend the tandoori chicken burrito with plain wrap, 3 different salads of your choice and chilli sauce on top.
			</p>
			<p>

			<a id="coffeeRevs"><h1>Coffee Revolution</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				Coffee Revolution is the SU's own coffee shop and is a great place to "meet friends, study, or just for taking time out to treat yourself".
				They offer a variety of different coffees, teas, smoothies, as well as some breakfast options.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/coffeeRevs3.jpg" alt="Picture of coffee revolution" title="Coffee Revolution" width=100%> <!-- Picture of Coffee Revolution -->

			<p>
				Their food options range from hot sandwiches, breakfast, or even waffles. I'd recommend the filled croissants  (I usually go for
				ham and cheese) as they are always hot and delicious.

				dish.
