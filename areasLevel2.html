			<h2>Foundry</h2>
			<p>
				The foundry is the SU's nightclub which hosts a variety of different types of events each night such as 'ROAR', 'Pop Tarts' and special
				themed nights. All of this along with cheap and affordable drinks makes the foundry a must try venue for students.

				to book and buy tickets to old and new films which the 'Film Unit' has selected.

			<p>
				Both small indie films and big blockbusters are shown here, giving film lovers and people looking for a casual night out
				the chance to find something for them at this unique cinema.

			<h2>Other</h2>
