		<h1>Typical Week</h1>
		<p>
			In this page we'll look into the typical week of a Computer Scientist and how they can best use the SU building
			to either get something to eat, study or to socialise with friends. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In a typical day you might have about 3 hours worth of free time in between lectures or labs for that day.
			In those hours the SU building is a great place to go to fill the time effectivley, and still being in the 
			University campus makes it easy to get anywhere in the University for your next lesson.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Grabbing something to eat for lunch</h2>
		<p>
			The SU building is the perfect place to grab food in your free time. As discussed in depth in our <a href="food.html">food</a>
			page the SU building has everything you could want from fast food to fine dining, and everything inbetween.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our pick for fast food would be 'Proper Pasty', as their wide range of different pasties are all unique and delicous and ready
			to eat straight away. You won't be disapointed with the food nor the price, and in a quick pinch there's nothing better.
			We discuss more on our <a href="food.html">food</a> page if you'd like to find out more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our pick for a casual meal is 'The Inteval' bar and cafe with a variety of modern takes on traditional Italian food, including; 
			pizzas, a range of pasta dishes, mouthwatering desserts and more, Interval has a choice for anyone and everyone. You can
			find out more about the interval on our <a href="food.html">food</a> page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, out choice of fine dining is 'Inox Dine' the SU's own fine dining restaurant located on 5th level of the SU. It's
			safe to say you won't be disapointed with Inox, as long as you don't mind paying for the extra niceties as this restaurant is
			sure to impress with nominations for the best fine dining restaurant in 2018. You can find out more about Inox on our 
			<a href="food.html">food</a> page.
		</p>	

		<h2>Study areas</h2>
		<p>
			The SU has lots of study areas for students to use in their free time, which we find very useful to use due to its easy access
			and quite environments. It's much easier to get work done in free time than at home as well as you're left without any distractions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The best places to do some work in your free time would probably level 4, and the gallery areas there. You'll find computers,
			large and small tables, for group and individual work respectivley, and also where the SU printer in located.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most food places and cafes also can be good places to do some work, as long as you don't find the noise a big ditraction.
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out more about SU level 4 visit our page on the various <a href="areas.html">areas</a> of the SU building.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Places to socialise</h2>
		<p>
			The SU is a great place to socialise with friends if multiple people have frees at the same time (which will be common in
			first year). 
		</p>
		<p>
			On of the best thing to do is to meet at nice cafes or bars which might also serve food, if it's around lunch time as the
			cafes and bars in the SU are always lively and vibrant, and usually on the cheap side from other places in Sheffield.
			Most also offer board games to play with friends, which is a simple as picking up from a cupboard or asking behind the bar for
			one of the board games.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're not in the mood for eating or getting some drinks, then the activities and sports zone is a great place, to just
			sit and talk in a quiter environment and also enjoy playing some table tennis if you're up for it. Just ask for the balls and
			bats at the reception desk and you're free to play whenever.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, we'd reccomend bar one for those looking to play some pool, darts, and if it's later on grab a drink with some friends.
			Bar One's cheap drinks and lively atmosphere always make it a great place to socialise with friends.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Things to do outside university</h2>
		<p>
			Outside univerity the SU can be good to do other things too and not just be about univerity work. The SU offers a small supermarket
			to buy any of your needs for the week in 'Our Shop'. The SU can be a great place to grab food during the weekend too, as all
			food places are open during the weekend, so if you're in town it can be a great place to grab some food and drinks too.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, in level 2 of the SU is the Nelson Mandella Auditorium, which hosts a variety of films shown there every other day - from
			classic movies to relativly new movies. This large and high quality vanue is the perfect place to go with friends to see a
			great movie. Find out more on our <a href="areasLevel2.html">SU level 2 page</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>My typical week</h2>
		<p>
			In my typical week I use the SU in many different ways. Depending on the day and what assignments and work I have to complete,
			can change my tyical routine but on an average week I have a large free on Mondays, a one hour free on Tusdays, small free on 
			Wednesdays, one hour free on Thurdays, and finally a large free on Friday.
		</p>
		<p>
			For all of these days I like to get some food, either food I've brought in but I eat it somewhere nice in the SU, or food I
			buy at one of the various food places around the SU (my favourite being proper pasty).
		</p>
		<p>
			If there is some work that has been assigned that's in soon or that is going to be a large project I'll usally complete or 
			at least research and look into it further in my extra free time using the SU's facilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, during the week I might decide to use the SU building for time outside University, and either watch a cheap movie in
			the Nelson Mandella audatorium or go out at Bar One or the Foundry.
