				In this page, we'll look into the typical week of a Computer Scientist and how they can best use the SU building
				to either get something to eat, study or to socialise with friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a typical day, you might have about 3 hours worth of free time in between lectures or labs for that day.
				In those hours the SU building is a great place to go to fill the time effectivly, and still being in the
				University campus makes it easy to get anywhere in the University for your next lesson.

			<a id="grabbingFood"><h1>Grabbing something to eat for lunch</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				The SU building is the perfect place to grab food in your free time. As discussed in depth in our <a href="food.html">food</a>
				page the SU building has everything you could want from fast food to fine dining and everything in between.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our pick for fast food would be 'Proper Pasty', as their wide range of different pasties are all unique and delicious and ready
				to eat straight away. You won't be disappointed with the food nor the price, and in a quick pinch, there's nothing better.
				We discuss more on our <a href="food.html">food</a> page if you'd like to find out more.
			</p>
			<!-- here!!!!!!!! -->

				<img src="./images/properPasty2.jpg" alt="Picture of proper pasty" title="Proper Pasty" width=100%> <!-- Picture of proper pasty -->
			</figure>
			<p>
				Our pick for a casual meal is 'The Interval' bar and cafe with a variety of modern takes on traditional Italian food, including;
				pizzas, a range of pasta dishes, mouthwatering desserts and more, Interval has a choice for anyone and everyone. You can
				find out more about the interval on our <a href="food.html">food</a> page.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/interval3.jpg" alt"Picture of the interval" width=100%>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Finally, out choice of fine dining is 'Inox Dine' the SU's own fine dining restaurant located on the 5th level of the SU. It's
				safe to say you won't be disappointed with Inox, as long as you don't mind paying for the extra niceties as this restaurant is
				sure to impress with nominations for the best fine dining restaurant in 2018. You can find out more about Inox on our
				<a href="food.html">food</a> page.

			<a id="studyAreas"><h1>Study areas</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				The SU has lots of study areas for students to use in their free time, which we find very useful to use due to its easy access
				and quiet environments. It's much easier to get work done in free time than at home as well as you're left without any distractions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The best places to do some work in your free time would probably level 4, and the gallery areas there. You'll find computers,
				large and small tables, for individual and group work respectively. Here you'll also find the SU printer to print off any work you might have.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/gallery1.jpg" alt"Picture of the gallery - level 4" width=100%>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Most food places and cafes also can be good places to do some work, as long as you don't find the noise a big distraction.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find out more about SU level 4 visit our page on the various <a href="areas.html">areas</a> of the SU building.
			</p>

			<a id="socialise"><h1>Places to socialise</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				The SU is a great place to socialise with friends if multiple people have frees at the same time (which will be common in
				first year).
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the best things to do is to meet at nice cafes or bars which might also serve food if it's around lunchtime as the
				cafes and bars in the SU are always lively and vibrant, and usually on the cheap side in comparison to other places in Sheffield.
				Most also offer board games to play with friends, which is as simple as picking one up from the cupboard or asking behind the bar.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/coffeeRevs1.jpg" alt"Picture of Coffee Revoloution" width=100%>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you're not in the mood for eating or getting some drinks, then the activities and sports zone is a great place to
				sit and talk in a quieter environment or enjoy playing some table tennis if you're up for it. Just ask for the balls and
				bats at the reception desk and you're free to play whenever.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we'd recommend bar one for those looking to play some pool, darts, and if it's later on, grab a drink with some friends.
				Bar One's cheap drinks and lively atmosphere always make it a great place to socialise with friends.
			</p>

			<a id="outsideUni"><h1>Things to do outside university</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				Outside university, the SU can be good to do other things too and not just be about university work. The SU has a small supermarket called
				'Our shop' where you can buy any of your necessities for the week. The SU can be a great place to grab food during the weekend too, as all
				food places are open during the weekend, so if you're in town it can be a great place to grab cheap food and drinks.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/ourShop1.jpg" alt"Picture of our shop" width=100%>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Finally, in level 2 of the SU is the Nelson Mandella Auditorium, which hosts a variety of films shown there every other day - from
				classic movies to relatively new movies. This large and high-quality venue is the perfect place to go with friends to see a
				great movie. Find out more on our <a href="areasLevel2.html">SU level 2 page</a>.
			</p>

			<a id="myWeek"><h1>My typical week</h1></a> <!-- One of main headers -->
			<p>
				In my typical week, I use the SU in many different ways. Depending on the day and what assignments and work I have to complete,
			 	my typical routine can change but on an average week I have a large free on Mondays, a one hour free on Tuesdays, small free on
				Wednesdays, one hour free on Thursdays, and finally a large free on Friday.
			</p>
			<p>
				For all of these days I like to get some food, either food I've brought in but I eat it somewhere nice in the SU, or food I
				buy at one of the various food places around the SU (my favourite being proper pasty).
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./images/suOutside1.jpg" alt="Picture of " width=100%>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If there is some work that has been assigned that's has to be handed in soon or that is a large project I'll usually complete
				or at least research and look into it further in my extra free time using the SU's facilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, during the week I might decide to use the SU building for time outside University, and either watch a cheap movie in
				the Nelson Mandella auditorium or go out at Bar One or the Foundry.
