		<h1>Food</h1>
		<p>
			In this page we'll talk about and explore the various different places to grab some food in the SU building, and giving you 
			our opinion of each one.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Interval Cafe Bar</h2>
		<p>
			One of the main attractions of the SU's level 2 is the 'Interval' cafe and bar which describes itself as a "laid back and 
			sophisticated cafe bar serving a selection of fine wine, continental beers, Fairtrade hot drinks and tasty cuisine". 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Interval Bar and Cafe is a perfect location to go for a nice lunch or dinner. Their extensive lunch and dinner menus leave
			you with lots of choice of different foods, all of which are sure not to disappoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			The slightly higher prices means it might not be the best place to go every week, but could be a nice treat to have lunch there
			with a friend every so often. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The pleasant atmosphere and comfy decore all add to the experience making your time there all the more memorable.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would reccomend the arancini for starter, the linguini meatball marinara for main, and chocolate brownie stack for 
			dessert if you can fit it all in. Other options are their artisan pizzas or their tasty sandwich meal deals, 
			which cut the cost down significantly.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Their full menus and more can be found at the <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/interval">SU's page</a> 
			for the Interval. 
		</p>

		<h2>Bar One</h2>
		<p> 
			Inside level one of the SU we have 'Bar One', a Students' Union bar which prides itself on its 
			"burgers, quizzes, sport and friendly staff!".
		</p>
		<p>
			As a more lively venue, Bar One is the go to venue for students wanting a cheap night out, or a place to hang out and have a
			drink before going into town.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bar One's tasty burgers and pool tables make this the perfect stopping point for an evening out with friends, or could
			even serve as a great place to grab a pub lunch and watch the football on the big screens.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information on Bar One's and its menus visit the <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/bar-one">SU's page</a> 
			for the Bar One. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Grill & Go</h2>
		<p> 
			On the third floor of the SU we have 'Grill & Go', a "campus favourite...perfect for those on the go". They offer
			a variety of different fast foods including  "burritos, hot wraps and salad boxes", all of which are "cooked fresh 
			and made to order".
		</p>
		<p> 
			Grill & Go's quick, cheap and easy food is a must try at some point during your time here in Sheffield. They offer a wide range
			of interesting and unique combos of burritos and wraps, all made to your order in front of you.
		</p>
		<p> 
			If you're in the need of a quick meal, and are in the mood for a wrap or burrito don't think twice, go to Grill & Go.
		</p>
		<p> 
			I would reccomend the tandori chicken burrito with plain wrap, 3 different salads of your choice and chilli sauce on top. 
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information on Grill & Go click the link <a href="https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/grill-go">here</a>. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Coffee Revolution</h2>
		<p>
			Coffee Revolution is the SU's own coffee shop and is a great place to "meet friends, study, or just for taking time out to treat yourself".
			They offer a variety of different coffees, teas, smoothies, as well as some breakfast options.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Their food options range from hot sandwiches, breakfast, or even waffles. I'd reccomend the filled croissants  (I usually go for
			ham and cheese) as they are always hot and delicious.
		</p>
		<p>

			coffee revolution.
		</p>
		
		<h2>New Leaf</h2>
		<p>
			If you're looking for a more healthy option then make sure to try out 'New Leaf' - "Sheffield Students' Union's innovative Salad Bar",
			where you can "create the perfect take away salad or wrap for yourself".
		</p>
		<p>
			Forget your boring packed-lunch salad, 'New Leaf' offers hundreds of combinations for you to pick from, all fresh and ready to
			eat.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		
		<h2>View Deli</h2>
		<p>
			The view deli is the SU's deli which hosts "freshly made vegetarian, vegan and gluten free treats and tasty lunches" on the 4th floor
			of the SU building.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're vegan or vegetarian the view deli is likley to become your new favourite cafe in or around Sheffield.
			Thier menu hosts a large variety including  but not limited to "stuffed peppers, sweet potato skins, falafel wraps, spinach souffl√©, 
			omelettes, crepes, fruit salads and pastries". With its own balcony and fantastic views over Sheffield, the view deli is also
			a great place to sit and enjoy your food with some friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find out more infomation at the <a href="http://withus.com/hustleandbustle/the-view-deli/">withUS web page</a> 
			about the view deli.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Proper Pasty</h2>
		<p>
			Located on Level 3 is the 'Proper Pasty' shop. Offering up a mouth-watering selection of handmade, traditional pasties and pizzas, 
			this small shop is the perfect place for students who want to grab a quick bite to eat. With a limited edition pasty brought out each
			month, there is always something exciting and new to try.
		 
		</p>
		<p>
			To find out more about the 'Proper Pasty Company' please visit <a href = "https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/proper-pasty">
			official SU's web page</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Inox Dine</h2>
		<p>
			On the 5th floor of the SU lies the high end restaurant, cafe, and lounge bar 'Inox' which hosts business lunches, stylish evening dinners,
			afternoon tea and much more. It's currently being nominated for the 'Best high end resaurant in Sheffield' award in the 'Sheffield Social
			Awards'. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I would reccomend the chicken or cauliflower satay with Pak Choi, Toasted Peanuts and Pickled Chillies. This dish is perfect
			if you're looking for a high end nice lunch, and the choice of chicken or cauliflower means everyone can try this delicious
			dish.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can book a table <a href="http://inoxdine.co.uk/reservation/">here</a> or visit their <a href="http://inoxdine.co.uk/">website</a>
			to find out more about thier menu's, events and reviews for the resaurant.
