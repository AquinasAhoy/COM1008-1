			<h2>Interval</h2>
			<p>
				One of the main attractions of the SU's level 2 is the 'Interval' cafe and bar which describes itself as a "laid back and
				sophisticated cafe bar serving a selection of fine wine, continental beers, Fairtrade hot drinks and tasty cuisine".
			</p>

			<p>
				We describe more about the Interval in our <a href="food.html">Food</a> page. And you can view the menu and more information on the
				Interval cafe and bar on the <a href="https://su.Sheffield.ac.uk/eat-drink-shop/interval">Official SU's web page</a> on the Interval.
			</p>

			<h2>Foundry</h2>
			<p>
				The foundry is the SU's night club which hosts a variety of different types of events each night such as 'ROAR', 'Pop Tarts' and special
				themed nights. All of this along with cheap and affordable drinks makes the foundry a must try venue for students.

			<h2>Auditorium</h2>
			<p>
				The auditorium or Nelson Mandela Auditorium is a lecture theatre and 'Film Unit' cinema, which hosts a variety of films for the public
				to book and buy tickets to old and new films which the 'Film Unit' has selected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both small indie films and big blockbusters are shown here, giving film lovers and people looking for a casual night out
				the chance to find something for them at this unique cinema.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find out about the films being shown and to buy tickets visit the <a href="https://tickets.sheffieldstudentsunion.com/more-inside/">
				SU's page</a> for the events.
			</p>

			<h2>Other</h2>
			<p>
				There are also some other things to do on level 2 that might be useful to know that it's there, such as, a prayer room, SU cash office,
				LGBT lounge, music room and other offices as shown on the map above.
			</p>

				The toilets next to the auditorium have also changed to gender-neutral toilets, and some of the offices are closed off at this time
			 	due to works being done on level 2.
